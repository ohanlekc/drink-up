*SUMMARY:* This is a project I completed in my Computer Graphics course. The terrain is made by a math equation, and is different every time. The goal of the game is to move around the terrain and collect the water pieces and avoid the fire pieces. 

*HOW TO RUN:* Clone the repository and open in VSCode. Click on the index.html file, and then click the "Go Live" button on the bottom right of your screen. To play the game, click anywhere on the screen and then use the "W", "A", "S", "D" buttons to move around.
